# Catarat

Over 9 million people in India are affected by Cataract (in 2015), and also 15 million people are partially or completely blind

Project Cataract is an Android app which will help the vision impaired through speech 

The app works like a normal camera app ,but   when shown over any object, the app recognises it, and speaks over what the object is. This will help the cataract affected or the blind easily identify objects they touch or comes over their way

> Warning : This is a prototype. Some images may not detect or summarized text will be improper
